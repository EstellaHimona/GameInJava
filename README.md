# GameInJava
As part of the Programming in Java module I was to build a game of my choice. Some functions are part of the university's ready-made library (that was created for this module). 


The project is separated into three milestones, as this was the way it was submitted for marking. 
I have also attached the CityEngine library which was given to us in order to help us with some functionality for our programs.
