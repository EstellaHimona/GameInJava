    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Illusion scene</h3>
    <p>
	So my first programming project is concluding the 2-week Programming Bootcamp. 
	I created an illusion scene in which circles are fading in and out of the screen, in a certain way so to create something like a maze of circles.
	As you will be watching the project running, you will find out that the movement of the cirlces synchronises with the background music I added to the sketch!
	While running this project, it is highly recommended to keep your eyes focused on the white circle which appears in the centre of your screen!!

      <h3>Year1, Semester 2: Club Penguin - Bean Counters</h3>
            <p> Next thing I want to show is the 2D game I have done for the second semester of first year. It is a game very similar to the Club Penguin's Bean Counters Java game, which I used to love playing when I was younger.
     The game is very easy to play as the main goal is to grab as many bean counters as possible either from the floor, or falling from the sky. There are some obstacles though: 
        1. If the yellow penguin touches the bad penguin then the game is over.
        2. There's a red fish, mullet, which appears after some time on some of the levels and if it touches the yellow penguin then the game is over, or if it touches anything else in the world it just destroys it.
        3. You can use the left, right, up keys and the space bar for navigation.
